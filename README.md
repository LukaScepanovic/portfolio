Hello there! I hope you enjoy my personal portfolio.

It is built using react, so that it passes components across the page to make the design similar across the board, and make the website render faster.

Other than that, it uses netlify for free hosting, as well as netlify's form service, so that the form you see below works even without any backend configuration.

Hope you enjoyed it, and if you want to reach out to me, feel free to use the form or LinkedIn, and I'll be replying in no time.
